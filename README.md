# 🏠 Apple Home Dashboard Strategy

A pixel‑level Apple Home style dashboard for Home Assistant. Instantly turns your Lovelace dashboard into an iOS Home app experience: familiar layout, section structure, color language, typography, card behaviors, navigation and editing flow – all automatic.

![Home Overview](assets/home_screen.png)

> Fully customizable per dashboard: every change you make (favorites, section order, hidden sections, per‑room layouts, tall/regular card toggles, background, included switches, scene & camera order, etc.) is saved inside that specific dashboard’s Lovelace config. Create multiple Apple Home dashboards (e.g. Family vs Wall Tablet vs Kids) – each keeps its own independent appearance & layout without extra YAML.

## 🚀 Quick Start (2 minutes)

### Option 1: Install from Custom Repository (HACS)

1. Open HACS in your Home Assistant
2. Click the three dots menu (⋮) in the top right corner
3. Select **Custom repositories**
4. Add this repository URL: `https://github.com/gilsonsouzah/apple-home-dashboard`
5. Select **Dashboard** as the category
6. Click **Add**
7. Search for "Apple Home Dashboard Strategy" in HACS and install it
8. Restart Home Assistant

### Option 2: Manual Installation

1. Download `apple-home-dashboard.js` from the [latest release](https://github.com/gilsonsouzah/apple-home-dashboard/releases) or from the `dist` folder
2. Copy it to `/config/www/` in your Home Assistant
3. Add a Lovelace resource: `/local/apple-home-dashboard.js` (JavaScript Module)
4. Restart Home Assistant

### Configure the Dashboard

1. Create a new Dashboard (Settings → Dashboards → +) – give it a path like `apple-home` and switch it to YAML mode (Enable advanced mode in your profile if needed).
2. Open Raw Configuration for that dashboard and paste ONLY:

```yaml
strategy:
  type: custom:apple-home-strategy
views: []
```

3. Save & refresh – the Home (My Home) view, Rooms, Groups, Scenes & Cameras generate automatically. Enter Edit mode to customize.

Using the default Overview instead: You can replace the Overview dashboard the same way (edit its Raw Configuration and set the same `strategy` block). If you want to keep the original Overview layout, create a separate dashboard instead.

## ✨ What You Get (Apple Home Parity Highlights)

- Automatic My Home view with smart sections (Favorites, Status, Rooms, Groups, Scenes, Cameras)
- True Apple Home grouping: Lights, Climate, Security, Media, Other (+ Default Room for unassigned entities)
- One room page per Home Assistant Area – created automatically, plus a page for entities without an area
- Group pages (Lights / Climate / Security / Media / Other) just like Apple’s category filters
- Dedicated Scenes section/page (scenes + scripts) & Cameras sesction/page
- Favorites section identical in behavior to Apple Home’s “Favorite Accessories” row
- Tall vs Regular card layouts (thermostats, locks, alarms, cameras default tall – others regular)
- Color & icon language mirroring Apple Home (active vs inactive states, functional group colors)
- Context‑aware naming (removes redundant area names from accessory labels)
- Clean navigation with iOS‑style header & back transitions
- Camera tiles show latest snapshot & open live view (simple and Apple‑like)
- Responsive adaptive grid (mobile, tablet, desktop) following Apple spacing feel
- Readable in light or dark (neutral inactive surface, bright active surfaces)
- RTL & multi‑language aware (mirrors layout & chevrons)

---

## 🧠 Automatic Behavior

You add the strategy – everything else is discovered:

- Discovers all entities in your instance, groups them by Area & Domain
- Generates “Room” pages for every Area (and a Default Room for unassigned entities)
- Separates special domains into Scenes & Cameras sections/pages
- Adapts iconography (garage doors vs blinds, outlets vs generic switches, locks, alarm panels, media states)
- Applies Apple‑style active/inactive styling & tall layout defaults

No manual YAML card definitions required.

You can hide or reorder sections in Edit Mode.

---

## ✏️ Edit Mode & Customization

![Home Settings](assets/home_settings.png)
![Home Settings Modal](assets/home_settings_modal.png)
![Reorder Sections](assets/reorder_sections.png)

Long‑press the header Edit toggle (or press “Edit”) to enter Edit Mode. You can:

- Drag & drop accessories within a Room, Favorites, Scenes, Cameras, or Domain group
- Reorder sections on the Home view
- Hide sections you don’t want to see
- Mark / unmark favorites
- Toggle tall vs regular size (supported entities only: climate, lock, alarm, camera) per context
- Reorder Scenes and Cameras individually
- Per‑room reordering (each Room page keeps its own layout)
- Per‑domain ordering inside Room pages (Lighting, Climate, Security, Media sub‑groups)

All changes are stored with the dashboard and persist automatically.

---

## 🎨 Visual Language

- Active accessories: white surface, dark text, colored circular icon background (group color) – Apple style
- Inactive: translucent dark tile, colored icon, subdued text
- Thermostats: large temperature typography (tall layout) or compact inline (regular)
- Scenes / Scripts: action style (no state line, clean icon)
- Locks, alarm panels, cameras: tall for glanceable status & clarity
- Group colors:
  - Lights / Other (Outlets): Warm Yellow
  - Climate / Fans / Covers: Cool Blue / Mode color accent
  - Security (Locks, Alarm, Cameras, Sensors): Teal
  - Media: Neutral White icon on dark / inverted when active

## 🌅 Backgrounds & Appearance

Personalize the dashboard backdrop while keeping accessories readable. Choose or change background styles (solid, translucent, image-based or preset themes) directly from the Home settings – updates apply instantly across all views.

![Background Settings](assets/home_settings_modal2.png)

Notes:

- Background persists (per dashboard) after reloads
- Designed to maintain Apple-style contrast & legibility
- Works with light/dark system themes

---

## 🌐 Rooms & Naming Cleanup

Accessory names are automatically cleaned to remove redundant room/area names (mirrors Apple’s shorter labels). Example: “Living Room Lamp” in the Living Room page becomes just “Lamp”.

---

## 🔐 Security & Accessory Types

- Garage doors / gates get dedicated icons & grouping under Security
- Outlets distinguished from other switches
- Alarm panels & locks elevated with tall styling
- Motion / contact / occupancy sensors feed status summaries

---

## 📸 Cameras (User View)

- Snapshot tile (tall) – opens live stream on tap
- Graceful fallback icon when camera unavailable
- Shown in Home section and full Cameras page

(Underlying snapshot mechanics intentionally omitted – you just get a native feel.)

---

---

## 🔄 Updating

1. Update via HACS (or replace the single JS file manually)
2. Refresh the dashboard (customizations persist)

---

## 🧭 Tips

- Use Areas in Home Assistant – they drive Room generation & cleaner names
- Name scenes & scripts with friendly labels (appear exactly as given)
- Favor short entity names; area name removal keeps things tidy
- Use Edit Mode after first load to fine‑tune top‑level order & favorites

## 📱 Mobile Experience

Optimized for narrow viewports: adaptive grid, comfortable touch targets, and condensed header.

## ❓ FAQ (Condensed)

| Question                        | Answer                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Why is a room empty?            | The Area has no supported entities or they’re all hidden/disabled.                                  |
| Where are my sensors?           | Security/status‑relevant sensors feed summary/status; pure sensors may appear under Security/Other. |
| Can I manually write card YAML? | Not needed; the strategy generates all layout.                                                      |
| How do I reset layout?          | Remove / rename the dashboard, recreate – or clear saved customizations (future UI reset button).   |
| Can I localize labels?          | Uses HA language automatically (RTL supported).                                                     |
